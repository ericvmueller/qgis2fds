# *qgis2fds* plugin repository

The open source plugin to export terrains and landuse from the [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org)
geographic information system to the [NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS)](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/)
for wildfire simulation and atmospheric dispersion of fire pollutants.

 * **Learn** how to use this tool on the [wiki pages](https://github.com/firetools/qgis2fds/wiki).
 * **Discuss** about the usage on its [discussion group](https://groups.google.com/g/qgis2fds).

The development of *qgis2fds* has been funded by a grant from
the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation.

By the research project WUIFI-21 (High fidelity computational fluid dynamics modeling of forest fires
for Wildland-Urban Interface communities resilience and protection)
the participating organizations intend to extend the capabilities of FDS
on the prediction of wildland-urban interface fires propagation.
